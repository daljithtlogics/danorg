Divers are sometimes tempted to \u201cwork the system\u201d by joining outside of Southern Africa in the hope that they will then be taken to a South African medical facility and have their medical treatment paid for. Unfortunately for them, this ploy often backfires badly. If you join in a country other than South Africa, the evacuation benefits are aimed at repatriating you to that country. So if you choose to join as a member of your country of residence, evacuation will be back to your country of residence. In case of a diving emergency, of course, the whereabouts of the nearest, most appropriate emergency or recompression facility will determine the evacuation destination, so divers will be taken care of in the most appropriate facilities.

The selection of benefits offered to DAN members were therefore designed specifically to provide optimal diving emergency support (i.e. in terms of both emergency assistance and treatment) and to include a useful number of travel insurance benefits to accommodate common travel and medical emergency situations. However, DAN cover can only include a limited number of emergency-related injuries and illnesses. The emphasis remains on emergency medical benefits. So, DAN- SA cannot replace your medical aid."),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(864,"p"),e._uU(865,"Perhaps you may now be asking why have a DAN membership at all? That is a fair question.

That is simply not the time to discover that your medical aid is not able to assist you in getting the most appropriate treatment or advice. Their convenient 0800 toll-free number doesn\u2019t work in Zanzibar and even in South Africa, working your way through a multi-prompt menu from a cell phone is not what you need in a crisis. Also, getting documented authorisations takes time and nearly all private emergency service providers now insist on a written GOP before responding. That is not surprising given that most aeromedical evacuations in Africa come in at R200 000 or more and even evacuations by ambulance approach R20 000 plus when advanced life support services are involved. Evacuations are costly. Recompression, on the other hand, is not that expensive in Africa. In Europe, it may set you back about R100 000, but in South Africa the cost is usually under R20 000 unless multiple treatments are needed.
