					<h3>International Shipping Charges</h3>
					<p>All items shipped to all countries outside South Africa's borders will be quoted for.  The shipping quote will be emailed to you separately from your order confirmation as shipping options are varied and the option and shipping cost that best suits you must be selected by you.</p>

					<h3>Tax / VAT and Custom Duties</h3>
					<p>You will have to pay for VAT and Customs when the order arrives in the country you are sending it to.  Customers in Namibia and Botswana will only have to pay for the VAT applicable in the country of delivery and should be exempt from customs.  You will be contacted by an agent at our delivery company to finalise customs and VAT payments as well as any other handling fees which might be applicable before the goods can be delivered.  Handling fees could cost up to 10% of the invoice value.  Please take this into account when making a purchase, the DAN Shop cannot be held responsible for the VAT and Customs charges that are payable, as these charges are out of our control and are determined by the customs office in your country.</p>
