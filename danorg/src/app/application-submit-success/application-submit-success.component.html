	    <h2>Dive Trip Planning</h2>
		<p>Whether you’re taking a 24-hour flight to Fiji or a 23-minute drive to the shore, all diving involves some form of travel. Submitting a travel notification ensures that the DAN hotline team knows when you travel and notes this on our system. This information helps us to assist you with fast and speedy service when you need it. With the information provided, we are able to plan potential evacuation procedures and advise you on the availability of appropriate facilities at your dive destination.</p>
